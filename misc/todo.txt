- Wait until jam complete
- Create generic assets
  - Settings menu
  - Car
  - Tracer
  - Particle effects

Ideas:

- In vulkan renderer, use custom fog shader and increate camera far distance
- Enemies should target parts more carefully - e.g important parts or parts
  near the center of volume
- Enemy aim uses PID
- Extra dirt kicked up when drifting
- Emit smoke from damaged parts
- Leaderboard + screenshot
- Something to give player a reason to not fire all the time, e.g ammo
- Build mode camera can be panned with trackpad
- Save and load game state
- More complex enemy behavior
- part icons are 3D rendered with wireframe shader and can rotate
- Make metal hit particles more satisfying
- Arena has circular wall, enemy reverses when hit wall
- When garage open, display ticker animation to show new parts earned
- Grey-out parts with quantity of 0
- Add confirm dialog when clicking "next round"
- When arena is stuck (e.g enemy and player have no means of locomotion),
  randomly drop bombs or something to end arena
- Test mode in garage
- Paint mode
- Freeze mouse when rotating in garage
- Muzzle smoke and other particle effects should inherit parent velocity in a
  realistic manner
