Really want:

- Leave trails in dirt
  - Don't do this if it's desktop only
- Some sounds, e.g part hit, should be parented to a node
- Make gun impart small force on shooter and target
- Vehicle landed in dirt sound effect
- Fix bug where cursor becomes visible if another application steals focus
- Player engine sound should be louder
- Analytics
- Fix weird camera bug that happens when only cockpit part is left. Maybe
  happens becaues COM is below ground. Maybe recalculate COM.
- Destroyed parts still collide with vehicles
- Preserve camera zoom in global state
- Bigger vehicles should sound louder and deeper
- Balance game for non-optimal strats
- Some way of knowing where the front of the vehicle is in the garage and in
  the arena. Maybe style the cockpit or add a debug arrow.
- Make face hint flash red when trying to remove bridge
- Better enemy AI
  - Circle enemy AI type that tries to flank the player
  - Ram
  - When enemy has no guns, it tries to ram player
- Make it clear that after the game ends, the player may keep repeating the
  last round
- Different ground/fog/sky for each round e.g grass
- Add advanced info tooltips when hovering over part buttons
  - Guns
    - All problems can be solve with more dakka
    - Will not shoot through parts
  - Wheels
    - Wheels make you go faster and turn faster
    - Wheels towards the front will steer your vehicle
    - Destroyed wheels do not make you go faster
    - If all the wheels towards the front are destroyed, you will lose the
      ability to steer
    - Going fast makes you hard to hit
  - Armor
    - Blocks bullets
- Disable dynamic lighting when graphics setting is low
- Make face hint red when placement is not possible
- Set vehicle zoom based on size
- Test and run on linux
- Fix Safari and Firefox performance
- Fix Safari esc key bugs
- Fix Firefox Mac build crashing
- Fix gun placement exploit
- Fix bug where user can interact with parts in garage when pause menu is open
- Fix bug where tracers don't get cleaned up
- Fix bug where clicking start/resume/next round button triggers shooting
- Fix issue where restart button can be clicked while in garage if player
  pauses when round is won
- Double gib count on desktop
- Add tip to loading screen: "3D performance and stability sucks on Firefox :(
  I suggest you either use a different browser or download the game"
  - Same with Safari
- Prevent placing things on wheels
- Fix issue where enemies facing each other deadlock
- In garage, show a little picture that displays your next enemy
- At end of each round, let player pick up new parts in a satisfying way
- Gamma setting
- Better loading screens
- Fade walls based on distance to player

Refactor:

- Move camera pivot to top level in scene then turn off "top level" boolean

After game jam:

- Let player chose reward after each level
- Create generic assets
  - Settings menu
    - add gamma settings
  - Pause/unpause/start
  - Car
  - Tracer
  - Particle effects
  - Block placer
  - Export templates and scripts (esp mac signing)
  - Theme variants
  - Heightmap
  - Shader compilation
  - Camera control
  - Muzzle flash
  - Object pool
  - Fix bug: pausing does not affect timing logic
  - Separate global static from global non-static
  - Autoload with globals and music
  - UI kit with hover sounds etc
  - Music player with queue, switching, and fading, sound control
  - Make UI slider react instantly rather than on release

Ideas:

- Part health is preseved between rounds
- Speed up dirt hit effect using a mesh instead of particles
- Kill enemy if they manage to leave level bounds
- Kill enemy if they are immobile for too long
- AO in browser using a shader
- Automatically resize rows in settings page
- Preseve cursor position when pausing/unpausing
- Sun in sky
- When round won, display ticker animation on icons to show new parts earned
- Drifting
  - Extra dirt kicked up
  - Sound
- Different music in garage, win screen, and lose screen
- Add "reset my build" button to garage
- When you finish game, you are given a super cannon and play through the game
  from the start. Super cannon flings enemies.
- Start background should basically place trailer clips
- Crash damage
- Fire/smoke explosion effect when part is destroyed
- Smoke effect when bullet hits target
- Nuke explosion effect when cockpit destroyed
- Guns take time to rotate towards aim point (maybe spring?)
- Make gun not fire if pointing at self
- Display UI hints when hovering over things e.g button outline/bg color
- Make part buttons greyed out when value is 0
- Make damaged steering wheels turn freely
- In vulkan renderer, use custom fog shader and increate camera far distance
- Enemies should target parts more carefully - e.g important parts or parts
  near the center of volume
- Enemy aim uses PID
- Emit smoke from damaged parts
- Leaderboard + screenshot
- Something to give player a reason to not fire all the time, e.g ammo
- Build mode camera can be panned with trackpad
- Save and load game state
- More complex enemy behavior
- part icons are 3D rendered with wireframe shader and can rotate
- Make metal hit particles more satisfying
- Arena has circular wall, enemy reverses when hit wall
- Add confirm dialog when clicking "next round" or "rest my build" button
- When arena is stuck (e.g enemy and player have no means of locomotion),
  randomly drop bombs or something to end arena
- Test mode in garage
- Freeze mouse when rotating in garage
- Muzzle smoke and other particle effects should inherit parent velocity in a
  realistic manner
- Zoom with right click
- On death, camera aims at enemy that killed you and crosshair disappears
- Animate part buttons when hovering over them:
  - Rotate
  - Steer wheel
  - Fire gun
- Fix bug where pausing doesn't pause particles
