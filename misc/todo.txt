  from the start. Super cannon flings enemies.
- Start background should basically place trailer clips
- Crash damage
- Fire/smoke explosion effect when part is destroyed
- Smoke effect when bullet hits target

- Guns take time to rotate towards aim point (maybe spring?)
- Make gun not fire if pointing at self
- Display UI hints when hovering over things e.g button outline/bg color
- Make part buttons greyed out when value is 0
- Make damaged steering wheels turn freely
- In vulkan renderer, use custom fog shader and increate camera far distance
- Enemies should target parts more carefully - e.g important parts or parts
  near the center of volume
- Enemy aim uses PID
- Emit smoke from damaged parts
- Leaderboard + screenshot
- Something to give player a reason to not fire all the time, e.g ammo
- Build mode camera can be panned with trackpad
- Save and load game state
- More complex enemy behavior
- part icons are 3D rendered with wireframe shader and can rotate
- Make metal hit particles more satisfying
- Arena has circular wall, enemy reverses when hit wall
- Add confirm dialog when clicking "next round" or "rest my build" button
- When arena is stuck (e.g enemy and player have no means of locomotion),
  randomly drop bombs or something to end arena
- Test mode in garage
- Freeze mouse when rotating in garage
- Muzzle smoke and other particle effects should inherit parent velocity in a
  realistic manner
- Zoom with right click
- On death, camera aims at enemy that killed you and crosshair disappears
